## Introduction
WEBSF(**W**ebcirque **E**xtensible **B**ridgable **S**cripting **F**ramework), formerly known as ELSL(Extensible Light Scripting Library), is a multi-usage JavaScript Framework.

This version ditched most ideas once existed in ELSL to adapt modern browser, browser extension, Cordova and Electron. This JavaScript framework wished to close gaps between all those environments.

## Tested environments
* Modern browsers
  * Google Chrome / Chromium
  * Mozilla Firefox
* Browser extensions
  * Chrome Extensions API
  * ~Web Extensions API~
* Application embeded
  * ~Apache Cordova~
  * ~Electron~
  
## Builds
Script minification is done hourly. So if you wish to test WEBSF in-action, use **/dev** scripts instead of **/min**.

## Structure
WEBSF comes with a number of modules which can be used and removed easily. Every module requires **websf.main** to run.

## Docs
Documents might come at some point, so check for [project page](https://www.pwcq.dev/) to know if it is published.
