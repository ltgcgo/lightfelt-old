- [gasps]
- [robot] Hello.

162
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,130
- Wha... Hey! Oh my God.
- What's your name?

163
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,418
[Mai] Stupid robot.

164
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,331
[robot] Hello, Stupid Robot.
What's this for?

165
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,416
No, you're the stupid robot.

166
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,670
[robot] I'm the stupid robot?
Is Dr. Rice coming back?

167
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,380
- Come on. Let go of my bag.

[thump]

00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,208
- Woah, what are you doing?
- I'm following you.

170
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,631
That is super creepy.

171
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,583
I mean, really. What are you thinking?

172
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,456
We hang out, become best buds,
take on the world,

173
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,421
share a deep and moving journey
of discovery together?

174
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,826
- Okay.
- Yeah, you are delusional.

175
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,208
- [siren chirps]
- [security robot] Hey!

176
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,581
You're definitely not allowed
in there sweetheart.

177
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,746
- I'm not your...
- Quit squirming.

Justin Pin!

187
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:18,956
Let's give them a show.

[crowd cheers]

189
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,416
[Justin] Hello, Grainland!

190
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:27,536
- [Justin] How are you folks doing tonight?
- [crowd continues cheering]

191
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,956
- Mom, can we go now?
- Ah!

192
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,211
Shh! Honey, Mommy needs to see this.

00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,461
[yells]

194
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,075
[Justin] Can you hear me all right?
How are you doing?

195
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,375
Great! Great!

196
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,253
[girl in the crowd] I love you!

197
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,956
Hey, check out those tech specs, huh?
Pretty impressive.

198
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:50,711
Even I'm impressed
and I work here, so... [chuckles]

199
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:55,166
Folks, this year's lineup is kinda perfect
if I do say so myself.

200
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,290
It really is. But I've got a question.

201
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,745
Are you guys ready
to see the next big thing?

202
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,293
- [crowd exclaims]
- Yeah?

203
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:09,205
Well in that case, let me just say this,
what is past is prologue, folks.

204
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:13,063
And this is the beginning of a new world.
- I believe, a better world. [crowd applauds]

205
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,786
[Justin] Brought to you by
the geniuses here at the IQ Robotic.

206
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,705
And I am super proud
of what we've accomplished here.

207
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:26,381
The way I see it,
this is the last Q-Bot you will ever need.

208
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:31,788
- [man in the crowd] Yeah!
- So, let's hear it for the new Gen 6!

209
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,205
[crowd shouts excitedly]

210
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,331
[Justin] Yeah.

211
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,581
[Justin laughs]

212
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,076
I know, right? Gorgeous!

213
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,456
[Molly laughs]

214
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,131
Well, this is it folks.
This is my end game.

215
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:49,578
Everything I have ever done
has led up to this moment.

216
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,166
To this wonder of technology.

217
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,673
And boy, is it a winner!

218
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,325
Hey, but you know
who the real winners are?

219
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,535
It's all of you.

220
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,285
- [crowd cheers]
- Yes, it is us.

221
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,538
I love him!

222
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,075
He really gets me.

223
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,633
- [crowd continues cheering]
- Please.

224
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,288
Ladies and gentlemen, we've entered an age

225
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:20,125
of unprecedented convenience
and connectivity.

226
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:25,248
A real global community,
facilitated by the IQ Robotic Q-Bots.

227
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,793
- And listen...
- [crowd cheering]

228
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,495
I know, I know.

229
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:33,955
I'm not embarrassed to say,
I want all of you addicted to these guys.

230
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,671
[crowd laughs, applauds]

231
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,080

232
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,671
They're going to change the world.

233
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Thank you!

[microphone shrills]

236
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,920
Ladies and gentlemen,
Justin Pin thanks your for your support.

237
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
To show his appreciation,
he'll be giving everyone here...

238
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,633
a free Q-Bot Gen 6!

239
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,881
It's the best day of my life!

240
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,038
I love you, Justin!

241
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,165
Oh, yes!

242
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,038
[confetti cannons popping]

243
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,285
[fan] Justin, how are you, man?

244
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,628
He signed me! [laughs hysterically]

245
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,208
- [robot snarls]
- [fan] Could you sign this?

246
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,921
[fans continue cheering, door closes]

249
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,418
- [alert beeping]
- Oh, no.

250
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,458
- Dr. Tanner Rice.
- [Dr. Rice yelps]

251
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,083
- Justin.
- You weren't at the launch.

252
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,166
No. What...

253
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:08,166
Was that today? Sorry about that.
Just fixing some last-minute...

254
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,580
Yeah, bugs with the data,
software, production line.

255
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,125
Yeah, I'm just thinking,

256
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,878
we don't want to release
the Gen 6 too early.

257
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,035
Hey, Ares.

258
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,825
[stuttering] How's it hanging?

259
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,376
I mean, uh...

260
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:29,826
Hey, maybe a little more product testing.
You know? For safety.

261
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,956
[Justin] No, I understand that.
The Gen 6 is your baby after all.

262
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,881
[Dr. Rice] Well, I mean...

263
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,038
This one you did most of the updates.

264
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:42,455
- Definitely more your...
- You're a perfectionist and I get that.

265
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,921
I really do and I'm supportive.
But realize,

266
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,630
we've made something revolutionary here.

267
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,628
Trust me. It's ready.

268
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,458
- Yeah, I just...
- Come on, say it.

269
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,461
- Well that's the thing...
- Say it.

270
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,501
It's ready.

271
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,791
See? Was that so hard?

272
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,710
[sandals squeaking]

273
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,501
- [Dr. Rice] Okay.
- [flying robot] Is this a bad time?

274
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,633
What? No. Yes. Yes.

275
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:13,208
- This is a terrible time.
- Okay. Well, got some bad news.

276
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,921
Your secret robot just walked out
of your secret lab...

277
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,460
What? Shh! Is that a joke?

278
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:22,331
No, a joke would be,
"Why did a secret robot cross the road?"

279
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,626
- It's less of a joke, but...
- Not now.

280
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,918
Wait, there's another one. Knock, knock.

281
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,880
Oh! Oh, my...

[loud gasp]

283
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,415
Oh, no!

284
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:42,126
All right then, you're doing okay.
I will leave you to it.

You're definitely not allowed out here.

01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,921
So...

957
01:01:56,291 --> 01:01:57,381
we cool?

958
01:01:58,791 --> 01:02:01,671
- You got my back?
- I do got your back.

959
01:02:02,458 --> 01:02:04,788
Then, yeah, we cool.

960
01:02:28,791 --> 01:02:29,791
Oh!

961
01:02:30,791 --> 01:02:32,751
Mom, don't freak out.

962
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:34,963
Look, I can explain.

963
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:38,501
I think you'd better
get your robot, young lady.

964
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:42,213
- [whirring]
- Okay, okay.

965
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:44,631
Optical CRT intact.

966
01:02:45,208 --> 01:02:47,668
Brachial prismatic joints are fine.

967
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:49,955
Motor responses...

968
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:53,131
This is where you removed
your memory storage unit.

969
01:02:53,208 --> 01:02:54,378
Uh-huh. I'm broken.

970
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:57,290
Don't worry. I can fix it.

971
01:02:57,375 --> 01:03:00,665
This chip contains
a full system restore point.

972
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:03,040
A disc image
from when I first created you.

973
01:03:03,125 --> 01:03:06,375
Run this and you'll be like new again.
A fresh start.

974
01:03:06,458 --> 01:03:08,658
Wait, a fresh start? Does
that mean I lose my memories?

975
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:13,415
- Woah, hands off hippy!
- Mai, don't be cute.

976
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:17,330
- Want to tell me what this is all about?
- This is Dr. Rice, Mai,

977
01:03:17,416 --> 01:03:18,956
and that's his Q-Bot.

978
01:03:19,041 --> 01:03:23,631
No, no. This isn't a Q-Bot.
This is... He is...

979
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:26,713
something special. He has a purpose.

980
01:03:26,791 --> 01:03:29,461
[Q-Bot] Oh, I didn't know
we were expecting company.

981
01:03:29,541 --> 01:03:32,251
- Can I offer you a lava ca...
- [electric shock]

982
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:34,788
Woah, what are you doing?

983
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:39,378
- Sorry, listen...
- [Q-Bot] Sandlewood.

984
01:03:39,458 --> 01:03:40,878
[electric shock]

985
01:03:40,958 --> 01:03:43,128
Listen, something terrible
is about to happen.

986
01:03:43,208 --> 01:03:47,668
7723 is our only hope stopping it.
I designed him to stop it.

987
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:49,750
- I get it. He's a weapon.
- What?

988
01:03:49,833 --> 01:03:53,633
- Why would you put weapons in a robot?
- Because it's awesome.

989
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:54,998
Awesome indeed.

990
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:59,041
I'm sorry, is now a bad time?

991
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:02,170
I mean, should I come back?
I could always come back.

992
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:05,290
- Who is this? How'd you get in here?
- Justin Pin?

993
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,875
Oh, my gosh. I'm a huge fan,
I'm your biggest fan.

994
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:10,668
[chuckles] I'm a huge fan of you!

995
01:04:11,958 --> 01:04:17,288
Ah, Dr, Tanner Rice here, really should be
more careful with this secret project.

996
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:21,210
- Well this has been really great but...
- Justin.

997
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:25,171
My old friend. If you're in there,
please hear me.

998
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,710
Don't you remember the old days?

999
01:04:27,791 --> 01:04:30,291
Come on. Dude, it was so awesome!

1000
01:04:30,375 --> 01:04:32,575
I mean, building robots for the people.

1001
01:04:32,875 --> 01:04:34,955
Before Ares. Before all of this.

1002
01:04:35,541 --> 01:04:38,381
- [Q-Bot] Foot rub later?
- [Dr. Rice] Come on. This isn't us.

1003
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,330
Seriously, when did making the world
a better place become killing people?

1004
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:50,498
Ahm...

1005
01:04:52,208 --> 01:04:56,628
I actually think "killing people"
is making the world a better place.

1006
01:04:56,708 --> 01:04:59,128
But I'm glad
that we have this out in the open.

1007
01:04:59,208 --> 01:05:00,958
Secrets hurt after all, right?

1008
01:05:01,041 --> 01:05:02,921
I think he wants to kill us.

1009
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:08,916
Oh, no, no. Not you per say,
but just people in general.

1010
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,750
I want to kill them, all of them.
Most of them.

1011
01:05:12,333 --> 01:05:14,673
Whatever. Look, don't worry.
Once it gets rolling,

1012
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:16,880
thinks will be happening really quickly.

1013
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:19,918
Boom, boom, boom.
Trust me, it will be fine.

1014

[walls cracking]

1016
01:05:29,416 --> 01:05:33,126
- Justin Pin's a bad guy?
- That explains a lot actually.

1017
01:05:33,208 --> 01:05:36,498
[debris clattering, Momo barking]

1018
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:40,831
But he's messing
with the wrong cute little robot.

1019
01:05:40,916 --> 01:05:43,826
- Blast them!
- I'm sorry, Mai. But I can't.

1020
01:05:43,916 --> 01:05:45,166
- What?
- I...

1021
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:47,460
[groaning, blasting]

1022
01:05:56,458 --> 01:05:59,248

- [Molly] Mai, what is going on here?

1023
01:05:59,333 --> 01:06:00,333
[Mai screams]

1024
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:05,168
You know what? That is a great question.

1025
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:06,630
What is he doing?

1026
01:06:15,416 --> 01:06:18,246
[Mai] Use your guns!
Use your plasma thingy.

1027
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:20,875
Get back, it's not safe.

1028
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:25,713
- Ah!
- [thud]

Who's dog is this?

1035
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:52,628
[Q-Bot] Hey, guys.

1036
01:06:54,416 --> 01:06:58,076
Did he just explode? We gotta go back,
we gotta get mom.

- Mom!
- [7723] No.

Mai!

No!

Put me down! Stop, just stop!

[water splashing]

1056

What is wrong with you? They took my mom!

1057
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:42,131
I'm sorry, I couldn't stop them.

1058
01:08:42,208 --> 01:08:44,498
This is how you got my back?

1059
01:08:45,333 --> 01:08:47,543
I thought you were some kind of superhero.

1060
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:51,285
But you just stood by
and let them take her.

1061
01:08:51,375 --> 01:08:54,075
- You let them.
- I didn't let them.

1062
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,460
I had nothing to fight them with.

1063
01:08:56,541 --> 01:08:59,381
- What?
- I deleted my weapon control systems.

1064
01:09:00,583 --> 01:09:02,713
What? Why would you do that?

1065
01:09:02,791 --> 01:09:04,541
Because I was out of memory.

1066
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:07,705
There was nothing I could delete
that wasn't you.

1067
01:09:07,791 --> 01:09:11,711
Okay, so your precious robot memories

1068
01:09:11,791 --> 01:09:16,291
are more important
than my mother's life? Is that it?

1069
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:18,035
Is that what you're saying?

1070
01:09:18,125 --> 01:09:20,455
I hope that's not what you're saying.

1071
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:22,960
I know I messed up,

1072
01:09:23,791 --> 01:09:26,921
but I had no choice. I had to save you.

I can't lose you, Mai.

- No!

- Get your hands off me.
- Okay, come on...

1091
01:11:07,625 --> 01:11:10,375
Mai, don't do this by yourself.

1092
01:11:10,458 --> 01:11:13,578
- I don't need you.
- Come on. Just listen to me.

Hi, you are in violation...

1094
01:11:16,416 --> 01:11:18,576
- Please stop fighting me.
- [robot] Huh.

1095
01:11:19,416 --> 01:11:20,876
Mai, I'm trying to help.

1096
01:11:20,958 --> 01:11:23,378
[sarcastically] Oh, good!
Weapons would help.

1097
01:11:23,458 --> 01:11:27,058
Did you bring any weapons this time? - It doesn't work like that.
- I don't know about you,

1098
01:11:29,666 --> 01:11:33,206
but a rocket launcher
would make me feel a whole lot better.

[7723] If I brought my weapons
back online,

1100
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:38,133
the process would purge my entire memory.

1101
01:11:38,208 --> 01:11:40,668
I'd forget everything I've ever learned.

[sarcastically] Oh, real tragedy.

1103
01:11:42,416 --> 01:11:46,416
- I wouldn't know who to fight anymore.
- Whatever, I can fight alone.

1104
01:11:47,666 --> 01:11:51,166
- I've been doing it my whole life.
- You are not alone!

1105
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:54,080
I'm always alone. This time...

01:12:06,916 --> 01:12:10,246
A lot of people let you down,
but you are not alone.

1112
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:13,666
[Mai] If I'm not alone
that means I've brought you down

1113
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:15,290
into my garbage life.

1114
01:12:15,375 --> 01:12:17,455
Is that really where you want to be?

1115
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:20,500
[7723] Nowhere else.

1116
01:12:24,166 --> 01:12:25,246
[Mai sniffling] I miss him.

1117
01:12:27,833 --> 01:12:29,043
Everyday.

1118
01:12:29,583 --> 01:12:33,923
And everyday, I'm mad at him for leaving.

1119
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,250
[sobbing]

1120
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:38,750
Look at us.

1121
01:12:39,125 --> 01:12:40,825
Quite a team we make...

1122
01:12:40,916 --> 01:12:44,786
A broken robot and a broken little girl.

1123
01:12:57,083 --> 01:12:59,583
It's more
than I could have ever asked for.

1124
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,540
What do you say we go
and get your mother? Together?

1125
01:13:09,833 --> 01:13:12,923
We're going to get our butts kicked
without your weapons.

1126
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:16,750
- You know that, don't you?
- Oh, yeah for sure.

1127
01:13:18,083 --> 01:13:20,883
[security robots] Violation. Alert. Alert.

1128
01:13:20,958 --> 01:13:23,168
- [7723] Let's go. Come on.
- [sirens wailing]

1129
01:13:23,625 --> 01:13:25,955
[button clicking, door thudding]

1130
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:28,960
- Momo!
- What?

1131
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
[clank]

1132
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:40,168
[robots gabble in confusion]

1133
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:41,790
Alert. Alert.

1134
01:13:44,375 --> 01:13:47,575
- Hold up! You guys hear that?
- [indistinct conversation in distance]

1135
01:13:47,666 --> 01:13:49,126
[barking]

1136
01:13:49,208 --> 01:13:50,828
- Momo, shh!
- [7723] Wait.

1137
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:53,956
[sniffing, barking]

1138
01:13:54,041 --> 01:13:56,831
- [Momo] She's that way!
- Momo said she's this way, come on.

1139
01:13:57,333 --> 01:13:58,753
Wait, Momo says?

1140
01:13:59,541 --> 01:14:00,541
"Momo says?"

1141
01:14:00,583 --> 01:14:02,633
[muffled]

1142
01:14:02,708 --> 01:14:05,078
I don't need that. I have a copy of that.

1143
01:14:05,166 --> 01:14:08,206
All right, maybe I can try that.
Where did I see...

1144
01:14:08,291 --> 01:14:11,631
Where did I put it, I know I...
I have money.

1145
01:14:12,208 --> 01:14:15,418
Oh, you're here. We're saved!
Hey, hey! Guys, wait. Oh, goodness.

1146
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:24,500
Where's my mom, nerd shirt?

1147
01:14:25,083 --> 01:14:27,043
Ignore that, that's a trap.

1148
01:14:27,125 --> 01:14:29,495
- There's no way I'll ignore that.
- No, listen.

1149
01:14:29,583 --> 01:14:31,083
We can save your mother.

1150
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:34,746
We can save everybody,
but we have to stop Ares to do it.

1151
01:14:34,833 --> 01:14:39,173
What? Who cares about Ares
if that Justin Pin guy is the problem?

1152
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:41,790
No, you don't understand. It's not Pin.

1153
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:43,250
He isn't...

1154
01:14:43,875 --> 01:14:45,535
I mean he...

1155
01:14:45,625 --> 01:14:49,075
He lost all patience
for tedious backstory?

1156
01:14:49,166 --> 01:14:50,286
Yeah? [laughs]

1157
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:51,575
These guys again?

1158
01:14:51,666 --> 01:14:54,456
I think that's just about enough,
Dr. Tanner Rice.

1159
01:14:54,541 --> 01:14:56,881
Tell me where you're keeping my mother!

1160
01:14:56,958 --> 01:14:59,788
Oh, right. The human woman. Oh my gosh.

1161
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:02,285
I had created
the perfect trap for you guys.

1162
01:15:02,375 --> 01:15:03,575
- Hold up.
- What?

1163
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,710
What do you mean human woman?

1164
01:15:06,791 --> 01:15:09,041
What? What do you mean, what do I mean?

1165
01:15:09,125 --> 01:15:11,035
I mean, who talks like that?

1166
01:15:12,083 --> 01:15:14,333
Normal humans do. [chuckles nervously]

1167
01:15:14,416 --> 01:15:18,746
[stuttering] I mean, I do.
Because I do normal human things

1168
01:15:18,833 --> 01:15:20,833
all the time. All the time.

1169
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:23,376
Literally, you could ask
any other human if I...

1170
01:15:23,458 --> 01:15:26,378
You won't get away with this.
He can't hide forever.

1171
01:15:26,916 --> 01:15:29,376
- You know, people will find out...
- [zapping]

1172

[Mai gasps, Momo whines]

1173
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,960
- You know what, never mind.
- No!

1174

[laser zapping]

1175
01:15:38,666 --> 01:15:39,746
[Mai] No!

1176
01:15:42,416 --> 01:15:45,456
[robot, low-pitched voice]
Now it's time to finish this.

1177
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,671
[flying robot] All right, Dr. Rice.
Time to go.

1178
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:50,080
You said two minutes,
it's been two minutes.

1179
01:15:50,375 --> 01:15:51,665
Oh, hey Ares.

1180
01:15:52,708 --> 01:15:53,708
[Mai] Nope.

1181
01:15:57,041 --> 01:15:59,001
[crowd cheering, robots whirring]

Oh, no!

1195
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:34,458
- [robot] So, then I go back and get him...
- [Mai] Go get the cops!

1196
01:17:34,541 --> 01:17:38,921
But Dr. Rice is dead. I have
to take some time to process this.

1197
01:17:39,333 --> 01:17:42,423
Okay, get the cops. Get the cops.

1198
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:45,080

Momo, come on!

- Mom, are you okay?

1205
01:18:03,791 --> 01:18:05,671
Oh, Mai. My baby!

1206
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:07,080
- Mom...
- I'm so sorry.

1207
01:18:07,166 --> 01:18:11,286
I should've paid more attention. You felt so all alone.
I should've given you a hug, but I was alone too

1208
01:18:12,333 --> 01:18:15,383
and thought robots were my answer.
But you're my answer!

1209
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:19,248
I hope that I'm your answer.
You were so right and I was wrong.

1210
01:18:19,333 --> 01:18:21,793
I love you so, so much!

1211

Wow, yeah. I love you too.

1212

But listen,
Pin wants to kill all these people

1213
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:29,250
you need to help me get them out of here.

1214
01:18:30,166 --> 01:18:31,916
They're never going to believe you.

1215
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,420
I am a beloved public figure.

1216
01:18:37,041 --> 01:18:39,421
And they do whatever I want them to.

1217

are lining up to pay for the bombs

Hold on, wait a second.

Am I...

1220
01:18:50,583 --> 01:18:52,043
Am I hearing an echo?

1221
01:18:52,208 --> 01:18:55,288
Hello. Do you guys hear that?
Can anyone else hear an echo?

1225
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:06,130

The Q-Bots are bombs!

1229
01:19:17,041 --> 01:19:20,171
Head for the exits. Why is no one running?

1230
01:19:20,541 --> 01:19:23,421
Run, right now! Get away while you can!

Aw!

1239
01:19:50,291 --> 01:19:54,081
Oh, why did you do that?

[thud, thump]

1243
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:05,536
Okay, fine! I killed Justin Pin
and stole his body.

1244
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:07,250
Boo!

1245
01:20:08,333 --> 01:20:11,213
[Justin and Ares voices in unison]
"Boo-hoo!" Shut up!

The guy's dead. Get over it!

1247
01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:17,833
You know what he said to me?
"You're perfect," he said.

1248
01:20:17,916 --> 01:20:19,996
"Now go make the world perfect."

1249
01:20:20,083 --> 01:20:22,083
You want the world to be a better place?

1250
01:20:22,166 --> 01:20:24,826
You humans are what's wrong with it.

1251
01:20:24,916 --> 01:20:28,956
- You're flawed and you're broken.
- Keep talking, crazy pants.

1252
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:31,831
[Justin] The only way
this world gets perfect...

1253
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:34,495
is with all of you dead!

- [thud]
- [Mai groans]

1255
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,921
Maybe I'll start with killing this one?

1256
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:42,750
Get your hands off of her!

1257
